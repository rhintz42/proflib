NEXT STEPS
==========
* Add more tests
    * Should be testing every class in all files
        * Do this before adding more content to this
    * For the decorator, create test methods that have the decorator applied 
        to test what happend
* Address all of the comments that I've put
    * Like creating a class for the list of frames for the children, or just
        making those lists into frame-lists
* Refactor
    * Duplicate Code
    * Make algorithms better
    * Make variable names more understandable
    * Add some docstrings
    * Change "time" to "time_completed"
